## 📁 Machine Learning for Materials Science - AMPS

This folder contains scripts, notebooks, and resources of various ML techniques used to estimate the Stokes parameters of Neutron stars, crucial for understanding the polarimetric properties of : Accreting Millisecond Pulsars(AMPs). 

## 📁 Q-Learning Thesis Module

This folder holds the code and documentation from my thesis project focused on reinforcement learning.  It features my implementation of Q-learning and its application to parameter optimization.
